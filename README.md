# MathSims

This was a small python project for my PHY101 (Mechanics) course. I used Matplotlib and TKinter to create interactive simulations for certain assignment questions. This helped visualize thus better understand the concepts discussed during the course.





#### Newtons Cannon
- This interactive simulation lets you experiment with firing a cannon from a mountaintop, moddeling Isaac Newton's famous thought experiment.  It lets you see how a cannonball's trajectory changes with different launch speeds, and how, at a critical velocity, the cannonball transitions from a ballistic projectile to an orbiting one. This demonstrates the fundamental connection between projectile motion and celestial mechanics.

#### Pi Approximator
- This simulation investigates the concept of pi (Ï€) through a visual approach. It progressively inscribes regular n-sided polygons within a unit circle, where n represents the number of sides. By calculating the perimeters of these inscribed polygons, the simulation approximates the true value of pi. As the number of sides (n) increases, the inscribed polygons become more numerous and their edges better align with the circle's circumference, leading to a progressively more accurate approximation of pi. This simulation offers a dynamic visualization of the relationship between polygons and the elusive value of pi.
